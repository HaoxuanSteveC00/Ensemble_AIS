This repository contains all the code used for reproducing the results in the paper "Ensemble-Based Annealed Importance Sampling" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15645).

Folder 1: Gaussian Mixture

Figure 1(a), 1(b), 1(c), 2(a), 2(b), 3(a), 3(b), 3(c) and 3(d) are all obtained via running the script "Two_Dim_Gaussian_Mixture_Test.m", which calls the helper function implemented in the script "GM_log_pdf.m".

Folder 2: Ginzburg Landau 1D

Figure 4(a) and 4(b) are both obtained by running the script "oneD_GL_minimizers.m",  which calls the helper function implemented in the script "oneD_GL_grad.m".

Figure 4(c), 5(a), 5(b), 5(c), 5(d) are all obtained via running the script "oneD_GL_test.m", which calls the helper functions implemented in the two scripts "oneD_GL_PDF.m" and "oneD_GL_grad.m".

Folder 3: Ginzburg Landau 2D

Figure 6(a) and 6(b) are both obtained by running the script "twoD_GL_minimizers.m",  which calls the helper function implemented in the script "twoD_GL_grad.m".

Figure 6(c), 7(a), 7(b), 7(c), 7(d) are all obtained via running the script "twoD_GL_test.m", which calls the helper functions implemented in the two scripts "twoD_GL_PDF.m" and "twoD_GL_grad.m".
